# Lifecycle of a task

## 1 ATDD - Research what you need, what is blocking you, what issues it can bring, and then clear up all doubts, before doing the first task

## 2 In progress - Start working on it, unit testing on local, move it to production(main), test on prod

## 3 In Review - will be marked when you have tested the feature in production on main not on local - Explain the QA what you built so that they can test all the aspects, provide screenshots of what you built.

## 4 In Review - QA will mark in-testing and raise defects if any, if blocker, assign task back to developer with detailed bug/defect description

## 5 Done - Will only be marked by QA (not dev) once they have tested on production
